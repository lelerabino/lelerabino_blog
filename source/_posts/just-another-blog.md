# Quick answer
>Yes, precisely, this is just another blog.

And below I want to share my specific motivations:
<!-- more -->
# Why am I blogging?

1. To force myself fighting **stagnation and laziness**. Blogging is a tangible proof of a journey. 

2. Because I'm a follower of the **[grow-mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck)** theory; with this blog, I don't want to demonstrate that _"Hey, I am super cool, I don't fail!"_; instead I want to share that _"try, experiments, and failure are the most important ingredients for the next challenge"_.

3. **Sharing, communication**: I'd like to found people to share my thoughts or my code and get any useful feedback.

4. As a developer, design and implement simply are not enough: I believe in the power of a **team** and, with a wider perspective, of the whole community; that's why in my opinion the ability to convey with the right **language** the concepts, the experience and to listen to feedback is simply essentials. Blogging is one way to train this skill.

5. Because a blog is, after all, a (small) **piece of web** and I am a web developer. This way I can use it as a perfect container for my tests.

6. To improve **my English**! I must apologize for my very basic level and for my mistakes, but I don't want that my first language (Italian) to be a bottleneck for a potential friend, collaborators or simply interesting people.

# Why Now?
Another question that I posed to myself when I started this blog was: _why now?_.
In this case, the answers are also very specific to my own experience:

1. Because I am in the middle of a **turning point** in my career and my life; I finished an important chapter of my professional path and I am about to start a new exciting adventure, which involves a radical change in terms of working team, environment, technology, logistics and so on. For these reasons the motivation and the timing are perfect, I think, to create something that for many years was spinning in my mind but I always postponed.
2. Because the web development ecosystem is changing a lot in the last years: the web platform progresses, the open source explosion, the whole community ability to contribute and give immediate feedback... all these aspects make this _job_ very exciting but also the meaning of **seniority** and **skillset** are becoming much more volatiles; blogging in my opinion, together with public coding, is the right way to grow and contribute as an active part of the whole community.
3. And finally because...**why not**?!
